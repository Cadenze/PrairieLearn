# Request your course space

  **are we updating the instructions to request a course? How should I update this page?**

To request your PrairieLearn course space, you can use the "Request course" links on the PrairieLearn home page or in the main dropdown menu.

This will bring you to a web form where you can request your course.

This would also be a good opportunity to join the PrairieLearn slack, if you haven't already: [https://go.illinois.edu/joinplslack](https://go.illinois.edu/joinplslack)
