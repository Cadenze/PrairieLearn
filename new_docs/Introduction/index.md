PrairieLearn is an online problem-driven learning system for creating and delivering learning experiences and assessments for students. It is based on the concept of “questions as code”, enabling instructors to write arbitrary code (HTML and Python) to interact with students and provide immediate feedback and grades. PrairieLearn's core technology enables very powerful questions that can randomize and auto-grade themselves, and can access client- and server-side libraries to handle tasks such as graphical drawing, symbolic algebra, and student code compilation and execution.

We developed sophisticated code execution algorithms within PrairieLearn that enable millisecond-level latency for secure execution of hosted code in time-sensitive environments like exams. The hosted question code uses adaptive rule-based algorithms to generate and grade different randomized versions of activities and assessments for topics such as symbolic mathematics, interactive student drawing and live coding. The use of auto-grading in PrairieLearn can entirely eliminate the use of human graders in university courses. PrairieLearn includes multiple novel grading algorithms based on rigorous mathematical theory, with provable game-theoretic properties to motivate student learning in a gamified environment, rewarding students for mastering content as quickly as possible. Multiple published research studies have demonstrated that these incentivization algorithms lead to substantial improvements in student learning outcomes.

PrairieLearn also includes a suite of algorithms designed to substantially reduce cheating in online environments. These start with stratified random selection of question generator code on a per-student basis to generate personalized, parameterized exams for each individual student. Post hoc analysis algorithms in PrairieLearn then analyze assessment performance with validated psychometric instruments to ensure accurate assessment of ability. Several large-scale research studies have rigorously demonstrated that these algorithms can almost entirely eliminate cheating in real university courses, while maintaining fair and accurate assessment of student learning.
