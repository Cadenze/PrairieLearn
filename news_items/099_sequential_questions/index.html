<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Thanks to the work of <a href="https://astrosticks.com">David Mitchell</a> (Illinois CS), assessments can now be configured 
  for students to complete questions strictly in the order that they appear. For instructors who want to configure 
  worksheets, labs, etc. where each question builds off of previous knowledge, this feature is for you.
</p>
<p>
  Adding the key <code>advanceScorePerc</code> with a value between 0 and 100 at any level of your 
  <code>infoAssessment.json</code> config will cause all questions under that category to require 
  a submission that's correct to at least that percentage before allowing students to access later questions.
</p>
<p>
  If a student runs out of attempts on a question, the next question will unlock automatically.

<h2 class="mt-4">Example</h2>

<p>This config will produce the following assessment:</p>
<pre class="border rounded bg-light p-2">
...
"zones": [
  {
    "advanceScorePerc": 80,
    "questions": [
      {"id": "demo/demoNewton-page1", "points": [3,2,1]},
      {"id": "demo/demoNewton-page2", "points": [3,2,1]}
    ]
  }
]
...
</pre>
<p>
  <img src="example1a.png" class="border rounded" title="An assessment where the first question is a link, and the second question is greyed out with a lock icon next to it.">
</p>
<p>
  To help students understand how these features affect them, informational tooltips will be shown to them:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="example1b.png" class="border rounded" title="Tooltip next to the lock icon: &quot;You must score at least 80% on Question 1 to unlock this question.&quot;">
</p>
<p class="mb-5">
  <img src="example1c.png" class="border rounded" title="Tooltip next to the &quot;next question&quot; button from inside of a question: &quot;You must score at least 80% on this question to unlock the next. If you run out of attempts, the next question will unlock automatically.&quot;">
</p>
